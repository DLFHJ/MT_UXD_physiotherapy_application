# Master Thesis - User Experience Design for a Digital Physiotherapy Application
This repository contains the application I created as part of my master thesis. The prototype is a web-app that is built upon the Google MediaPipe framework. 

The application allows users to select an exercise which is then tracked via webcam. The user then receives feedback on how well they are performing the exercise.

This application is supposed to be a technical slice, an interactive prototype to show basic design considerations and the technical feasibility.
